        <h3>Breif Biography:</h3>
        I am currently pursuing my masters in computer science, with concentrations in Data Science, and Cybersecurity at Bradley university.<br>
        Before that I earned my bachelors degree in mechanical(production) engineering during the time period of 2017 through 2021 at Muffakham jah college of engineering and technology, Hyderabad, Telengana, India.<br>
        During the years 2015 and 2016 I attended Narayana Junior college, Hyderabad, Telengana, India for my 11th and 12th years of schooling which is also called intermediate education in India.<br>    
        I attended Nasr School Boys through grades 1 to 10(2005-2015).
    </p>

        <h3>Values And Beliefs:</h3>
        One of the educational values that are fundamental to me is achievement. This is as a result of my belief that what defines me most as a person is my determination to succeed. 
        Achievement is therefore one of the values that is most important to me since in today's world, achievement and success are mostly tied together with educational success. 
        As a result of this, I hold my educational exploits in high esteem since education is one of the avenues where one's determination leads to quantifiable success.

        <h3>Career Aspirations:</h3>
        As I stated before, I did my bachelors in mechanical engineering, which before joining i was extremely interested in but after beginning I quickly found it hard to be interested in the courses being taught as most of them were heavily theory based with very little practical work.
        I have always learned better when I can practice or apply the topics I am being taught while studying them. during my second year of engineering I took a course on c programming and I quickly developed an interest in computer science. Later, during the Covid-19 lock-down I did a couple courses on python programming, these courses made me realise that i would like to pursue this as a career.
        So I decided to do my masters in Computer Science and I hope to work in the Tech industry.

        <h3>Interests and Hobby's:</h3>
        My favorite hobby by far is gaming, I have been playing computer games for as long as I can remember. I made a lot of friends and learned a lot of things through this hobby.
        The next Hobby would be reading, I started reading at a very young age as my mother also loved reading so she would buy me a lot of books. I would read anything I could get my hands on as a child from newspapers to magazines to encyclopedias.
        I also extremely enjoy cooking, taking raw ingredients and turning it into good food is a very satisfying process.

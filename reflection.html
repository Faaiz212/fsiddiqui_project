        <p>I have always enjoyed learning. As a child i used to read encyclopedias for fun, it seemed weird to the other kids but 
            getting all the information i could was always fun for me. I used to read everything i could get my hands on from a young age,
            from newspapers to novels. In recent years i have not been reading as much, so one my my goals is to get back into the habit.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I have mentioned in my profile, I did my bachelors in mechanical engineering, so making the switch to Computer Science in my masters was 
            a big decision that took a lot of deliberation. But after my first semester i knew i made the right decision, because i did better in my first 
            semester masters than i ever did in all 4 years of my engineering. The topics ive learnt have been more interesting and better suited to me.
            I always learnt better when i could practically apply and practice the stuff taught as i learnt it, this was not really possible in mechanical 
            engineering but is the norm in computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, i hope to continue down the path of computer science by getting a job in the tech industry.
